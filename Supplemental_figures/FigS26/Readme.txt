these are the motif analysis files and scripts for 4 species 

in each folder:
a file called <nameofspecies>_contig_withgenes_analyzed. It shows the total coverage of each motif and the fraction on the x. which was used to plot the graphs of abundunce

we have the <nameofspecies>__contig_with_genes which we used to do overlap against <nameofspecies>_fimo and overlap script
<nameofspecies>_contig_with_genes is a full motif analysis along with motif next to genes and including siginficance value and expected values
