dist_dsim_rsp
dist_dsim_1.688near

are matrices that used to plot Figure(x). They are distance matrices dismulans showing distance between clusters along with cytoband information. They are the input for the script biocircus_newscale.R


simlary matrices:
mat_hiseq_cluster_rsplike
mat_hiseq_cluster_1.688
mat_hiseq_cluster_rsplike_updown
mat_hiseq_cluster_1.688_updown

but for biocircus_hiseq_plot.R
updown indicates that these are the only cluster upstream and downstream
